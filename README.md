## About The Project


![ProductScreen Shot](./assets/product.gif)


This is an API for a social network that uses a NoSQL database so that its website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. This application is built with Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I used moment.js to format the date. MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.
